He graduated from NYU (1983) and majored in Economics and Pre-Med, with Minors in Chinese History and Chemistry. He received his JD from Univ Idaho, and MDiv from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.

                "Discipling Godly Men and Women,
                Building Godly Families,
                Raising Godly Children"
                Together they have discipled numerous singles and couples in pre-marital and marriage counseling for more than 20 years. They have four kids: Emmet (“the Truth” ), Artesia (“the Life”), Deryka (“the Way”), and Jedidiah (“the Love of God”).
