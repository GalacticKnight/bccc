            <p>The following anthology was created in the summer of 2023 by SBI (Summa Bible Institute) 7.0, a youth ministry team from Brooklyn Community Christian Church.</p>
            <p style={{textAlign:"center"}}>Our goal is to model ourselves after 1 Timothy 4:12:</p>
            <p class="alignAntho">Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</p>
            <p>
                Each SBI member has written their testimony, a story detailing their experiences with God and their acceptance of Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. Along with 
                their testimony, we have each submitted creative works which serve as expressions of our faith in Jesus. God has done so much in our lives, and we only wish to share 
                it with the world. We're hoping you will be inspired and moved by these works.
            </p>
